### Guidelines
- To add a feature, fix an issue or other create a branch from `main`.
- Naming branchs: feature/issue as title
    - To add a feature which shows about password strength in signup page.
    - Create a branch with `feature_password_strength`.
    - Adding prefix to describe an feature/issue `feature_XXXX`
- At each commit in branch add accomplished task in that commit.
- At the time before raising the pull request test weather the changes are giving a desired outcome.
- raise the pull request with the description format.
  ```markdown
  ## Features added
  - None (if no feature is addded)
  - feature description in short
  ## Issues
  - None (if no issue is fixed)
  - issue description in short
  ## Others
  - None (if no task accomplished)
  - task description in short
  ```
- If having any doubts ask others to review changes and commit
